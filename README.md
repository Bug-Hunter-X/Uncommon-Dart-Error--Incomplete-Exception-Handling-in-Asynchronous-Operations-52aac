# Uncommon Dart Error: Incomplete Exception Handling in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart code involving asynchronous operations and demonstrates how to properly address this problem to improve the robustness of your applications.

The `bug.dart` file contains code with incomplete error handling. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version that addresses potential issues.  The error is related to handling exceptions during JSON decoding and dealing with potential null values in the response.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` to see the potential error. 
3. Run `bugSolution.dart` to see the corrected implementation.  You'll need the `http` package in your `pubspec.yaml` and run `dart pub get` before execution.

## Key Improvements in the Solution

* **Explicit JSON Decoding Error Handling**: The solution includes error handling during JSON decoding using a `try-catch` block specifically for `jsonDecode` to catch `FormatException`s. 
* **Null Safety**: It incorporates null checks to ensure that potential null values from the JSON response are handled gracefully, preventing null pointer exceptions.  This is crucial for robust applications.
* **Comprehensive Error Reporting**:  Provides more context to error messages in case of issues during data fetching or processing.
